# CEREBRO
DOLORES COMPETITION

  
Make it about machine learning – that seems to be a theme behind Google’s return to robotics, an effort that reportedly has more to do with software than creating mechanical creatures that resemble human beings. Nowadays companies are synthetically generating more and more datasets from the realistic simulation of the dynamics of robots. Your task is to predict the angular acceleration (target) of one of the robot arm's links. The training dataset contains features like angular positions, velocities and torques of the robot arm.

This Competition provides an ideal starting place for machine learner geeks who may not have a lot of experience in data science and machine learning.

From the competition homepage.

Goal for this Notebook:
Show a simple example of an analysis of the REGRESSION PROBLEM in Python using a full complement of utilities. This is aimed for those looking to get into the field or those who are already in the field and looking to see an example of an analysis done with Python.

This Notebook will show basic examples of:
Data Handling
Importing Data with Pandas
Cleaning Data
Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn
Data Analysis
Supervised Machine learning Techniques: + RandomForest Regression + Plotting results + GridSearchCV + Outliers removal by IQR method
Valuation of the Analysis
K-folds cross validation to valuate results locally
Output the results from the IPython Notebook to the cerebro site
